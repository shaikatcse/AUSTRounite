The results are generated using NSGAII, two point crossover, swap mutation.
population size: 300
max Evaluations: 9,00,000
crossover probability: 0.90
mutation probability: 0.20

All the initial population is generated by smart Initialization. 


There is three special files: init, trackingHardConstrints, trackingSoftConstraints
init: two columns. Fisrt column reports the average hard constraint violation and second column presents the number of individual that violates constraints. 
tracking HardConstrints: report the generation number when first feasible individual is appeared in the population. 
trackingSoftConstraints: contains 3 columns. first column contains the generation, second column contain average soft constraint violation and the last colum contain the number of individuals that violate soft constraints
The question is why the soft constraint violation reported from a perticular generation. The starting generation is the first generation when all hard constriants are met.
