Preliminary experiments:
   Experiment to understand how much evaluations is required? With all the hard constraints in place, 
   I think we need at least 12,00,000 with 300 populationSize. The following things need to be noted:
   		1. After the smart initilization, we need to save the population to compare how much gain we got after the evaluation (evaluating the optimization is requied)
  		2. After hard constraints are handled, we need to track soft constraints for each generation (our approach for soft constraint works?)
  		3. Another run is required without smart initialization to show that it is very difficult to get feasible solutions. Recored number of infeasible solution in each generation.
		
		
	Run configuration:
		1. run the soft constraint version:
			1.1 Save the smart initial population
			1.2 Track soft constrains (averageTotalSofConstraints violation for each feasible individual, number of individual that violetes soft constriants ) for each generation after hard constraints are handled
		
		2. Run normal version without smart initialization
